- [SIGGRAPH'21] **TreePartNet: Neural Decomposition of Point Clouds for 3D Tree Reconstruction** [[paper](<origin/TreePartNet.pdf>)] [[note](notes/TreePartNet.md)] [[slide](notes/TreePartNet.pptx)] [[github](https://github.com/hhheyijia/paper-notes)]

  - TreePartNet:  A neural network aimed at reconstructing tree geometry from point clouds obtained by scanning real trees.

  - A prior-based supervised neural decomposition to learn a cylindrical representation of 3D trees even for incomplete or noisy point sets.

  - A new combined reconstruction method for tree structures based on generalized cylinders and branching points.

  - A geometry-aware graph clustering method based on a pairwise affinity network, which defines a new module, named Scaled Cosine Distance, inspired by the Transformer. 

- [preprint]**Content-Based Search for Deep Generative Models** [[paper](origin/Content-Based Search for Deep Generative Models.pdf)] [[note](notes/Content-Based.md)] [[github](https://github.com/hhheyijia/paper-notes)] 
  - We have introduced the problem of content-based retrieval for deep generative image models, whose goal is to help users find, explore, and share new generative models more easily.
  - We demonstrate that our model search retrieves suitable models for image editing and reconstruction, few-shot transfer learning, and latent space interpolation.

- [CVPR2017] **ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes** [[paper](origin/ScanNet_Richly-Annotated_3D_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf)] [[note](notes/ScanNet.md)] [[github](https://github.com/hhheyijia/paper-notes)] [[ppt](notes/ScanNet.pptx)]
  - ScanNet, an RGB-D video dataset containing 2.5M views in 1513 scenes annotated with 3D camera poses, surface reconstructions, and semantic segmentations.
  - We designed an easy-to-use and scalable RGB-D capture system that includes automated surface reconstruction and crowdsourced semantic annotation.
  - 3D object classification, semantic voxel labeling, and CAD model retrieval.

* [SIGGRAPH'08] **4-Points Congruent Sets for Robust Pairwise Surface Registration** [[paper](<origin/4-Points Congruent Sets for Robust Pairwise Surface Registration.pdf>)] [[note](notes/4pcs.md)] [[slide](notes/4pcs.ppt)] [[github](https://github.com/hhheyijia/paper-notes)] [[video](https://youtube.com/xxxx)]

  * 4PCS, a fast and robust alignment scheme for 3D point sets that uses wide bases, which are known to be resilient to noise and outliers.
