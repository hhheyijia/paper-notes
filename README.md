- [CVPR2017] ScanNet: Richly-annotated 3D Reconstructions of Indoor Scenes [[paper](origin/ScanNet_Richly-Annotated_3D_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf)] [[note](notes/ScanNet.md)] [[github](https://github.com/hhheyijia/paper-notes)] 
  - ScanNet, an RGB-D video dataset containing 2.5M views in 1513 scenes annotated with 3D camera poses, surface reconstructions, and semantic segmentations.
  - We designed an easy-to-use and scalable RGB-D capture system that includes automated surface reconstruction and crowdsourced semantic annotation.
  - 3D object classification, semantic voxel labeling, and CAD model retrieval.

* [SIGGRAPH'08] 4-Points Congruent Sets for Robust Pairwise Surface Registration [[paper](<origin/4-Points Congruent Sets for Robust Pairwise Surface Registration.pdf>)] [[note](notes/4pcs.md)] [[slide](notes/4pcs.ppt)] [[github](https://github.com/hhheyijia/paper-notes)] [[video](https://youtube.com/xxxx)]

  * 4PCS, a fast and robust alignment scheme for 3D point sets that uses wide bases, which are known to be resilient to noise and outliers.
